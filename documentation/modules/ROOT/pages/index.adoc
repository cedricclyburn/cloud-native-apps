You will create these components:

* **Catalog Service** exposes using a REST API content of a catalog stored in a relational database
* **Inventory Service** exposes using a REST API the inventory stored in a relational database
* **Gateway Service** calls the **Catalog Service** and **Inventory Service** in an efficient way
* **WebUI Service** calls **Gateway Service** to retrieve all the informations.

== Deploy a Spring Boot Microservice

_20 MINUTES EXERCISE_

In this section you will learn about deploying microservices using drag-and-drop feature of OpenShift Web Console.

image::coolstore-arch-catalog-spring-boot.png[CoolStore Architecture,400]


[sidebar]
--
image::spring-boot-logo.png[Spring Boot, 400]

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone Spring based
applications with embedded web containers such as Tomcat (or JBoss Web Server), Jetty and Undertow
that you can run directly on the JVM using **java -jar**. Spring Boot also allows producing a war
file that can be deployed on stand-alone web containers.

The opinionated approach means many choices about Spring platform and third-party libraries
are already made by Spring Boot so that you can get started with minimum effort and configuration.
--

This exercise starts by going to your `OpenShift Dev Spaces` and create a new workspace using the following repository URL as input `https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/catalog-spring-boot.git` via **Quick Add**:

[.mt-4.center]
image::dev-spaces-quick-add-create-workspace.png[Quick Add to Create Workspace]

Then click **Create & Open** button to import the project.

NOTE: You might be asked to login through link:https://github.com[GitHub.com^] with your user in order to access OpenShift Dev Spaces. This is due the GitHub OAuth plugin available in OpenShift Dev Spaces that let start using GitHub features such as Pull Requests, Issues etc from the environment. 

[.mt-4.center]
image::dev-spaces-import-from-git.png[Import Workspace from Git Repository]

Locate `/projects/catalog-spring-boot/src/main/resources/import.sql` in the newly imported project:

[.mt-4.center]
image::che-project-explorer-locate-file.png[Locate File in Project Explorer]

Add the following two lines of SQL into `import.sql`:

[source,sql,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
INSERT INTO PRODUCT (item_id, name, description, price) VALUES ('444439', 'Organic Cotton Quarkus twill cap', '100% organic cotton twill cap with an unstructured, low-profile, six-panel design. The crown measures 3 1/8 and this features a Permacurv visor and a buckle closure with a grommet.',13.00 );
INSERT INTO PRODUCT (item_id, name, description, price) VALUES ('165623', 'Organic Cotton knit socks', 'Your brand will get noticed on these full color knit socks. Imported.',4.15);
----

[.mt-4.center]
image::che-editor-add-lines.png[Add lines in Editor Window]

Next go to **Terminal** -> **Run Tasks..**  and select **maven-build**

[.mt-4.center]
image::run-maven.png[Run Maven build]

TIP: You can also do it via CLI as follows: go to **Terminal** -> **Open Terminal in Specific Container** and select a container with name **tools**.
A terminal window will open at the bottom of your editor and there you can input Maven commands such as `mvn clean install`.

image::universal-devimage-container-run-mvn.png[Run Maven in Terminal]

After packaging the application, you can expand your target folder on left-hand side and observe the results:

image::build-results.png[Build results,600,600,align="center"]

You should download the build results by right-clicking and saving the jar on your local computer.
In order to deploy our recent build we will use this downloaded jar.

* Go back to the **Topology view** of your `Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift`
* Drag and drop the downloaded JAR into the Topology

image::drag-and-drop.png[Drag and Drop JAR,600,600,align="center"]

Or:

* Click on +Add` button and locate the `Upload JAR File` option

image::upload-jar.png[Upload jar,600,600,align="center"]

Then:

* In the Upload JAR file dialog, browse the location of the jar from your local computer and modify the *`Builder Image Version`* to be `openjdk-11-el7`. Optionally, you can also modify the *`Runtime icon`* to `spring-boot`.

image::upload-jar-file-dialog-settings-1.png[JAR Upload Dialog,600,600,align="center"]

* In the *`General Section`* choose `Create Application` from the *`Application`*  drop-down , use `coolstore` as the *`Application name`* and set the *`Name`* to `catalog-spring-boot`:

image::upload-jar-file-dialog-settings-2.png[JAR Upload Dialog,600,600,align="center"]

* Press the **Create** button.

You can validate your deployment by accessing the application via its route url:

image::route.png[Route,600,600,align="center"]

This will open a new browser tab and you should see something similar to:

image::test-it.png[Test it,600,600,align="center"]

Then `*click on 'Test it'*`. You should have a similar array of json output:

[#yaml]
== Deploy Gateway Service using YAML

_10 MINUTES EXERCISE_

During this section you will deploy a scalable API Gateway that aggregates Catalog and Inventory APIs using Eclipse Vert.x

[sidebar]
--
image:vertx-logo.png[Vertx, 400]

http://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x^] is a toolkit for building reactive applications on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Vert.x does not 
impose a specific framework or packaging model and can be used within your existing applications and frameworks 
in order to add reactive functionality by just adding the Vert.x jar files to the application classpath.

http://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x^] enables building reactive systems as defined by http://www.reactivemanifesto.org[The Reactive Manifesto^] and build 
services that are:

* *Responsive*: to handle requests in a reasonable time
* *Resilient*: to stay responsive in the face of failures
* *Elastic*: to stay responsive under various loads and be able to scale up and down
* *Message driven*: components interact using asynchronous message-passing

http://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x^] is designed to be event-driven and non-blocking. Events are delivered in an event loop that must never be blocked. Unlike traditional applications, Vert.x uses a very small number of threads responsible for dispatching the events to event handlers. If the event loop is blocked, the events won’t be delivered anymore and therefore the code needs to be mindful of this execution model.
--

For this type of deployment we can use YAML files already available at https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/gateway-vertx.git.

* Go to your `Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift`.
* Click on **+Add** button and locate **From Local Machine** option, then select **From YAML**

image::from-yaml.png[From YAML, 600,600,align="center"]

* Locate the YAML files inside https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/gateway-vertx/blob/main/kubernetes/gateway-vertx.yaml and use the `Copy` feature of GitHub to copy their content.
* Now paste using control-v or command-v the YAML content in your sandbox and hit **Create** button.

image::import-yaml.png[Import YAML, 600,600,align="center"]

* You should see the following results:

image::successful-yaml-import.png[Successful YAML import, 600,600,align="center"]

Go back to the **Topology**, go to the newly created `gateway-vertx` and click to the little arrow as shown below, this will open the Gateway URL:

image::openshift-gateway-route.png[Gateway Vertx Route, 400,400,align="center"]

You can find the Route also by navigating to *OpenShift Web Console -> Project -> Routes* or the OpenShift CLI inside the Web Terminal:

== Deploy Web UI from Git

_15 MINUTES EXERCISE_

The Web UI is built using Node.js for server-side JavaScript and AngularJS for client-side
JavaScript. Let's deploy it on OpenShift using the certified Node.js container image available
in OpenShift.

In this section, you will fully use OpenShift https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/builds/understanding-image-builds.html[Source-to-Image (S2I)^].
OpenShift will obtain the application code directly from the source repository then build and deploy a
container image of it. 

In the OpenShift Web Console, from the **Developer view**,
`*click on '+Add' and select 'Import from Git'*`

image::dev-view-add-git-import.png[OpenShift - Add from Git]

* In the Git Import dialog fill in the *`Git Repo URL`* with `https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/web-nodejs.git`. Next click `show advanced Git options` to update the *`Git reference`* to `main`.

image::git-import-dialog-1.png[Git Repo URL and reference, 500]

* Further below in the dialog you will see the following notes about import strategies.

image::git-import-dialog-2.png[Import Strategy, 500]

* Click **Edit Import Strategy**, select 
the *`Builder Image`* strategy and OpenShift will autodetect the runtime needed by the code, which in this case should be Node.js

image::git-import-dialog-3.png[Builder Image Strategy]

* Specify the **Application**, select `coolstore`

* Scroll down to the bottom of the dialog where you see the following options.

image::git-import-dialog-4.png[Builder Image Strategy, 600]

* Click on **Deployment** the expand the section and add an environment variable. The environment variable name is `SECURE_COOLSTORE_GW_ENDPOINT` and the value is the URL associated with the Route to Gateway Service that you used in the previous section. 

image::git-import-dialog-5.png[Builder Image Strategy, 600]

* Press *`Create`* button to finish the deployment.


The final view of the deployed applications should be similar to this one:

image::openshift-all-deployed.png[Deployments Overview, 700]


You can also connect all microservices just from a visualization point of view as the following image: 


image::final-overview.png[Deployments Overview, 700]

You can check the deployed application by accessing the Route of the last deployment `web-nodejs`:

image::https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/web-nodejs/blob/main/coolstore-web.png?raw=true[Coolstore Shop,600] 

Congrats!! You have implemented an e-store using a microservices based architecture!

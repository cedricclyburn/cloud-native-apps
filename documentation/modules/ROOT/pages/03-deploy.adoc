https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^] is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot,
crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards.

**Container First**: https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^] tailors your application for GraalVM and HotSpot. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory
(not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms
like Kubernetes. We use a technique we call https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first[compile time boot^].

**Unifies Imperative and Reactive**: Combine both the familiar https://quarkus.io/vision/continuum[imperative code and 
the non-blocking reactive style^] when developing applications

**Developer Joy**: A cohesive platform for optimized developer joy:

* Unified configuration
* Zero config, live reload in the blink of an eye
* Streamlined code for the 80% common usages, flexible for the 20%
* No hassle native executable generation

**Best of Breed Libraries and Standards**: Quarkus brings a cohesive, fun to use full-stack framework by leveraging best of breed libraries you
love and use wired on a https://quarkus.io/vision/standards[standard backbone^].

Next, we will use Helm to deploy the `https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/inventory-quarkus` application.

* Go to your Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift and select `Helm` from the left hand side menu:

image::access-helm.png[Access Helm,600,600,align="center"]

* Click on `Install a Helm Chart from the developer catalog` link.
* Type `Quarkus` in the input field associated with search function and click on the result found.

image::helm-quarkus.png[Quarkus, 500]
* Click the `Install Helm Chart` button and follow the next steps to adjust the chart values.
* Change the release name to `inventory-quarkus`

image::inventory-quarkus.png[Inventory Quarkus,600,600,align="center"]
* Go to the `Build` section and expand it. Copy and paste the name of the repo: `https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/inventory-quarkus.git`

image::build-repo.png[URI to repo,600,600,align="center"]
* Finally, click `Install` button to have your charts installed.

== Deploy a Spring Boot Microservice

_20 MINUTES EXERCISE_

In this section you will learn about deploying microservices using drag-and-drop feature of OpenShift Web Console.

image::spring-boot-logo.png[Spring Boot, 400]

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone Spring based
applications with embedded web containers such as Tomcat (or JBoss Web Server), Jetty and Undertow
that you can run directly on the JVM using **java -jar**. Spring Boot also allows producing a war
file that can be deployed on stand-alone web containers.

The opinionated approach means many choices about Spring platform and third-party libraries
are already made by Spring Boot so that you can get started with minimum effort and configuration.
--

This exercise starts by going to your `CodeReady Workspaces` and input `https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/catalog-spring-boot.git` via `Quick Add`:

[.mt-4.center]
image::create-workspace.png[Create Workspace,600,600,align="center"]

Then click `Create & Open` button to import the project.

Locate `/projects/catalog-spring-boot/src/main/resources/import.sql` in the newly imported project and add the following lines to it:
[source,sql,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
INSERT INTO PRODUCT (item_id, name, description, price) VALUES ('444439', 'Organic Cotton Quarkus twill cap', '100% organic cotton twill cap with an unstructured, low-profile, six-panel design. The crown measures 3 1/8 and this features a Permacurv visor and a buckle closure with a grommet.',13.00 );
INSERT INTO PRODUCT (item_id, name, description, price) VALUES ('165623', 'Organic Cotton knit socks', 'Your brand will get noticed on these full color knit socks. Imported.',4.15);
----

Next, go to `Terminal` -> `Open Terminal in Specific Container` and select any container.
A terminal window will open at the bottom of your editor and there you can input `mvn clean install`:

image::mvn-clean-install.png[Maven,600,600,align="center"]

After packaging the application, you can expand your target folder on left-hand side and observe the results:

image::build-results.png[Build results,600,600,align="center"]

You may download locally the build results by right-clicking and saving the jar on your computer.
In order to deploy our recent build we will use this downloaded jar.

* Go to your `Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift`.
* Click on `+Add` button and locate `Upload Jar File` option

image::upload-jar.png[Upload jar,600,600,align="center"]
* Browse the location of the jar from your local computer and odify the *`Builder Image Version`* to be `openjdk-11-el7`:

image::builder-image-version.png[Builder image version,400,400,align="center"]
You can also modify the *`Runtime icon`* to `spring-boot`.

* In the *`General Section`* change the *`Application name`* to `coolstore` and the *`Name`* to `catalog-spring-boot`:

image::general-catalog-name.png[General Section,600,600,align="center"]

* Press `Create` button.

[TIP]
====
You can make the previous Helm installation of the Quarkus microservice part of your `coolstore` application by editing its labels and adding `app.kubernetes.io/part-of=coolstore`.

image::edit-labels.png[Edit labels,600,600,align="center"]
====

You can validate your deployment by accessing the application via its route url:

image::route.png[Route,600,600,align="center"]

This will open a new browser tab and you should see something similar to:

image::test-it.png[Test it,600,600,align="center"]

Then `*click on 'Test it'*`. You should have a similar array of json output:

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.

== Deploy Gateway Service using YAML

_5 MINUTES EXERCISE_

During this section you will deploy a scalable API Gateway that aggregates Catalog and Inventory APIs.
For this type of deployment we can use YAML files already available at https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/gateway-vertx.git.

* Go to your `Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift`.
* Click on `+Add` button and locate `From YAML` option

image::from-yaml.png[From YAML, 600,600,align="center"]

* Locate the YAML files inside https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/gateway-vertx/blob/main/kubernetes/gateway-vertx.yaml and use the `Copy` feature of GitHub to copy their content.
* Now paste the YAML content in your sandbox and hit `Create` button.

image::import-yaml.png[Import YAML, 600,600,align="center"]

* You should see the following results:

== Deploy Web UI from Git

_10 MINUTES EXERCISE_

The Web UI is built using Node.js for server-side JavaScript and AngularJS for client-side
JavaScript. Let's deploy it on OpenShift using the certified Node.js container image available
in OpenShift.

In this section, you will fully use OpenShift https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/builds/understanding-image-builds.html[Source-to-Image (S2I)^].
OpenShift will obtain the application code directly from the source repository then build and deploy a
container image of it. 

In the OpenShift Web Console, from the **Developer view**,
`*click on '+Add' and select 'Import from Git'*`

image::openshift-add-from-git.png[OpenShift - Add from Git, 700]

* Fill in the *`Git Repo URL`* with `https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/web-nodejs.git`.
Also, update *`Git reference`* to `main`.

image::git-url-branch.png[Git Repo URL and reference, 700]

* Next, select the *`Builder Image`* strategy and OpenShift will autodetect the runtime needed by the code.

image::builder-image.png[Builder Image, 700]

* Expand the `Deployment` and add environment variable.
The environment variable name is `SECURE_COOLSTORE_GW_ENDPOINT` and the value is the URL associated with the Route to Gateway Service.

image::secure-env-variable.png[Environment variable, 700]

In a second tab, find the URL associated with the Route to Gateway Service. You can find it using *OpenShift Web Console -> Project -> Routes* or the OpenShift CLI:

image::gateway-service-url.png[Gateway Service URL, 700]

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get routes
----

* Press *`Create`* button to finish the deployment.

You can check the deployed application by accessing the Route of the last deployment.
The final view of the deployed applications should be similar to this one:
